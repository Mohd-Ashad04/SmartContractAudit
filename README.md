# SmartContractAudit – AI-Powered Smart Contract Security Auditor

SmartContractAudit is an AI-driven auditing system that automatically analyzes smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, gas optimization issues, and code quality risks. The project uses a multi-agent architecture powered by Google Gemini and exposes a FastAPI backend with a simple HTML frontend. It is fully containerized using Docker and deployable on Render or any modern cloud platform.

# Overview

SmartContractAudit automates the process of analyzing smart contracts by leveraging a multi-agent AI architecture. The system identifies vulnerabilities, suggests gas optimizations, evaluates code quality, and provides a structured audit report. The goal is to provide fast and reliable smart contract analysis without requiring manual review by security experts.

# Key Features

### Security Analysis  
Detects issues such as:
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities  
- Integer overflows or underflows  
- Missing access controls  
- Unsafe external calls  
- Misuse of tx.origin  
- Incorrect function visibility  

### Gas Optimization  
Identifies:
- High-cost loops  
- Inefficient storage access  
- Redundant operations  
- Missing immutables/constants  
- Unused variables  

### Code Quality Review  
Checks:
- Naming standards  
- Event usage  
- Error handling  
- Modifiers and visibility  
- Best practice alignment with Solidity guidelines  

### Multi-Agent AI Workflow  
Includes:
- Security Agent  
- Gas Optimization Agent  
- Code Quality Agent  
- Report Compilation Agent  

Each agent communicates independently with Google Gemini.

# Working (Detailed Internal Workflow)

### 1. User Submits Contract  
The user submits a contract through the frontend or POST `/analyze`.

### 2. Backend Receives Request  
FastAPI validates and parses the request.

### 3. Gemini Model Initialization  
The system loads the LLM using `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### 4. Multi-Agent Setup  
The backend creates:
- Security Agent  
- Optimization Agent  
- Quality Agent  

Each agent has a role, goal, and task.

### 5. Agents Perform Analysis  
Agents independently query Google Gemini with specialized prompts.

### 6. Response Aggregation  
All agent outputs are merged into a single combined response.

### 7. Parsing Layer  
The combined output is structured into JSON:
- vulnerabilities  
- severity scores  
- optimization suggestions  
- recommendations  
- code-quality score  

### 8. Final Report Returned  
FastAPI returns the structured report to the UI or client.
